Diamond Price Prediction with Regression Analysis (.md)
This file outlines a project exploring diamond price prediction with regression analysis using R Markdown.

Project Structure

Data Exploration: Visualize data distribution and variable relationships.
Model Selection: Select the best-fitting model using AIC, BIC, etc.
Model Diagnostics: Identify and address potential violations of regression assumptions through transformations.
(Optional) Further Considerations: Discuss alternative approaches for handling violations and the complexity-accuracy trade-off.
Conclusion: Summarize key findings (final model, limitations, next steps).
Code Comments and Visualization

Code chunks include comments and visualizations to enhance clarity.

Areas for Improvement

Residual Plots: Include visualizations to showcase identified violations in residuals (non-centered, non-constant variance).
Normality Tests: Use Q-Q plots for visual assessment of normality alongside tests for categorical variables (code likely already generates these plots).
Transformation Results: Include the impact of transformations on coefficient estimates and diagnostics.
Conclusion: Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing key findings, model limitations, and future steps.
This project provides a solid foundation. By incorporating these suggestions, you can create a more comprehensive document.
