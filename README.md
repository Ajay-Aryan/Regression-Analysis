# Diamond Price Prediction with Regression Analysis

This repository explores diamond price prediction using regression analysis in R. The goal is to develop a robust regression model to predict diamond prices based on their characteristics while addressing regression assumptions and enhancing model interpretability.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict the prices of diamonds using various regression models, ensuring that the chosen model adheres to statistical assumptions and provides accurate predictions.

### Features
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset and visualize relationships between variables.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate multiple regression models and select the best one using criteria such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).
- **Model Diagnostics**: Assess regression assumptions (e.g., linearity, homoscedasticity, normality) and address violations through transformations or other techniques.
- **Optional Extensions**: Explore alternative methods to handle assumption violations and balance model complexity with predictive accuracy.
- **Conclusions**: Summarize findings, model performance, limitations, and future work.

## Project Structure

### Data Exploration
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Understanding the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Scatterplots and correlation heatmaps to explore variable relationships and detect potential multicollinearity.

### Model Selection
- Fit multiple regression models.
- Evaluate models using AIC, BIC, and adjusted R-squared values.
- Identify the model with the best trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.

### Model Diagnostics
- **Residual Plots**: Assess assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity.
- **Q-Q Plots & Statistical Tests**: Test for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test).
- **Transformations**: Address assumption violations and evaluate their impact on the model.

### (Optional) Further Considerations
- Discuss the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy.
- Explore advanced techniques like regularization or non-linear regression if needed.

### Conclusion
- Summarize key findings.
- Highlight limitations and areas for improvement.
- Propose next steps for future research or application.

## Implementation Details

### Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `ggplot2` for visualization
  - `dplyr` for data manipulation
  - `car` for regression diagnostics
  - `MASS` for model selection

### Code Comments
- Code chunks are commented to explain their purpose and functionality.
- Visualizations are included to enhance clarity and provide insights into the analysis.

## Areas for Improvement

### Residual Plots
- Add visualizations showcasing identified violations (e.g., non-centered residuals, non-constant variance).

### Normality Tests
- Incorporate Q-Q plots and statistical tests to assess normality.
- Include specific tests for categorical variables where applicable.

### Transformation Results
- Document the impact of transformations on coefficient estimates and diagnostics.
- Compare pre- and post-transformation model performance.

### Conclusion
- Summarize:
  - Final model selection.
  - Key insights and performance metrics.
  - Limitations and proposed next steps.
